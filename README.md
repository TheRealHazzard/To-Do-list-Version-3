# To-Do-List-Version-3

Final Version (I Think) . This is the To-Do-List created using NodeJs and EJS along with a database connection using MongoDB Atlas . 
You can create your own custom list by adding a "/{Your-List-Name}" to the end of the URL. A new List will be dynamically created only for that particular URL and can be accessed anytime. Completely Customizable and you can add/remove notes at will.
